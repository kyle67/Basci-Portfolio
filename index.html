      <p>My name is Kyle Daniels and I am thrilled to have the  opportunity to tranisiton into a career in Full Stack Development.
        My background has been in education for the last 20 years but I have always had a love and desire for technology. I attended Hampton University in Virgina where I majored in Mathematics and marched in the Hampton University Marcing Force.
        In additon to my love for music and technology, I  love to travel. My favorite destinations are Los Cabos and Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. My additonal hobbies include fishing, horseback riding, and chess.
      </p>
      <p>During my time in education I have served as both a Math teacher and as a Math Instructional Coach. As the Instructional Math Coach I lead leaderhip teams in data analysis of Common Assessment data. I created data visualizations for teachers and school leadership, along with projecting student achievment on state test using Benchmark data and Universal Screeners. </p>
      <p>The desire to transition from education in the tech world occured while taking a 10-week Data Analytics class at General Assembly. The idea of writing code to return data and then being able to create a story to tell about the data through data progamming language gave me the direction for my future career path.</p>
      <p>I look forward to this journey into the tech field and learning this craft to the degree that one day I can train others that desire to pursue the same dream.</p>
