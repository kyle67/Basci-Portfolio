        <p>Hello Boot Camp Team! My name is Kyle Daniels and I was born and raised in East Orange, New Jersey.
           I relocated to Atlanta in 2004 and love living in the "Dirty South". Some of the things I enjoy about Atlanta are the unique culture, diversity, and that we have plenty of places to eat.
           Fishing is a hobby of mine, so I definitely take advantage of the many parks and lakes that the Atlanta area has to offer such as Sweet Water Creek. I'm still trying to land that 10lb Bass but I'm edging closer with my personal best being a 6lb bass.</p>
    
        <p>Other fun things I do in Atlanta include riding a skooter on the belt line, hiking Stone Mountain, meeting friends out at a nice Jazz spot like Katz Cafe, and maybe catching a show at the FOX. My favorite FOX experience to this date has been seeing Chris Rock's standup.
                Lavelle Crawford is my favorite comedian and I'm hoping to catch him live one day in Atlanta. When I'm not out and about I enjoy lounging on the couch wathing Netflix. My favorit Nextflix show would be House of Cards followed by Sons of Anarchy. Breaking Bad was a good one also and I can't wait for season 3 of the OZARKS.</p>
        
        <p>I'm extremely excited to be a part of the GT Coding Boot Camp. I was torn between attending the Coding or the Data Analytics Boot Camp since I did have experience in Data Analytics from General Assembly. However these past two weeks have shown me that I made the right deciisons. The instructor, TAs, and my classmates have been great! I look forward to the experience as I transition into a new career.</p>
